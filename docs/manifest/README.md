# @spinajs/manifest

Versioned types, JSON Schema and helpers for the application manifest (`manifestVersion: 2`; version 1 fragments, whose `fullPath` and parameter `kind` values mean something else, are refused). See the package README for the reader, hash and merge helpers.

## Runtime

`@spinajs/manifest` exports a runtime that boots read from instead of scanning directories. It adds no dependency: it uses `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:module` and the package own validator.

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MANIFEST_TOKEN` | `'__manifest__'`, the DI key the loaded manifest is registered under. |
| `loadRuntimeManifest({ path, mode }, cwd?)` | Reads and validates the manifest. `off` never reads; `prefer` returns `undefined` when the file is missing; `require` throws `ManifestMissing`. Relative paths resolve against `cwd`. |
| `manifestFileFor(entry, manifest, cwd)` | Built `.js` file of an entry: `src/x/y.ts` of package P becomes `<root of P>/<outDir>/x/y.js`. |
| `packageRootOf(name, manifest, cwd)` | Install root of a package listed in `manifest.packages`, resolved the way node resolves it from the app root. |
| `appRootOf(manifest, cwd)` | App root: `SPINAJS_MANIFEST_ROOT` if set, else `app.root` when it exists on this machine, else `cwd`. |

`outDir` (relative to the package root, default `lib`) is recorded per package in `package.outDir` and `packages[].outDir`, and for the app in `app.outDir`. It comes from the `outDir` of the package's tsconfig.

A manifest built on one machine and run on another (container image, bundle) keeps working when `app.root` no longer exists there: the working directory is used, or set `SPINAJS_MANIFEST_ROOT` to the deployed app directory.

The `system.manifest` configuration section (`path`, default `app.manifest.json`; `mode`, default `off`) selects the file and the mode; it is defined by `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA` in `@spinajs/configuration`.
